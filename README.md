# Pi-hole API

## Testing Pi-hole API on version 6

Testing out the Pi-hole API after installing Pi-hole version 6 on a VM.

Currently sends a request to the API and then closes the request. It is likely that this will be constantly changing code until I understand the API.

The [existing documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/api/) is very weak, so I am setting up a testing framework for testing this with the idea of pulling queried DNS entries for parsing in the future.
